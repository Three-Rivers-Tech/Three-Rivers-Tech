# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the transformation of the Three Rivers Tech website from its current corporate-enterprise focus to a community-centered approach that serves the residents and small businesses of Turtle Creek, PA 15145 and surrounding Mon Valley communities. The transformation repositions Three Rivers Tech from "Professional IT Services for Growing Businesses" to a hometown tech partner offering "big-city know-how at small-town prices."

**Current State Analysis:**
- Website currently promotes enterprise-grade services (custom software, SaaS integration) 
- Testimonials feature corporate clients (operations directors, IT managers)
- Messaging feels distant to residents needing help with slow laptops or small shops needing basic websites
- Blue gradient hero looks corporate and generic, doesn't evoke local community

**Target Community Context:**
- Turtle Creek: Small borough in Allegheny County, projected 2025 population ~4,900, median age ~46
- Demographics: Working-class families and retirees, median household income ~$44,449 (below PA median)
- Community values: Reliability, personal relationships, supporting local businesses
- Local businesses: ~140-150 businesses, mostly single-owner shops, contractors, service providers
- Community engagement: Facebook groups, Turtle Creek Senior Center events, Memorial Day parade
- Preference: Residents prefer dealing with someone who "lives here" over faceless corporations

**Business Location:** 124 Grant Street, Turtle Creek, PA 15145
